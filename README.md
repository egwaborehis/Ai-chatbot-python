## Python AI Chatbot

A Python-based conversational AI chatbot built as part of my AI development learning.
This project included me integrating an external AI API into a Python application while managing conversation state and user input.

## Features would include:
- Sends user messages to an AI API and displays responses
- Supports multi-turn conversations using thread IDs
- Allows starting a new conversation thread
- Secure API key handling using environment variables
- Command-line interface for user interaction

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Requests (HTTP API handling)
- Environment variables for security
- Git & GitHub for version control

## How It Works:
1. The user enters a message in the terminal
2. The message is sent to an AI API endpoint
3. The API response is received and displayed
4. A thread ID is stored to maintain conversation context
5. The user can start a new thread or exit the program

## What I Learned:

- Integrating AI APIs into Python applications
- Handling JSON requests and responses
- Managing conversation state in applications
- Writing clean, readable Python code
- Using Git and GitHub to manage projects

## Future Improvements I could do:
- Add error handling for failed API requests
- Improve response formatting
- Extend the chatbot for a specific use case (e.g. study assistant)
